## <a name="example"></a> Example Application

You can quickly run and interact with some code by looking at the files in the `/example` folder. You run the example with the following commands:

```bash
$ npm ci
$ npm run example:start
```

This runs a simple server at `http://localhost:3000/` that serves the static `example/index.html` file. This allows it easily interact with Metamask. You can edit the `example/index.html` file to try different code.
