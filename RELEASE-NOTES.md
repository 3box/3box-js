## v1.12.0 - 2019-10-04
This release contains a feature called Ghost Threads. These threads are not persisted by in any way except in memory between users. Ghost Threads uses ipfs pubsub to send messages between peers, so in addition we have added a websocket signaling server to make peers discover each other easier. Ghost Threads includes a backlog for users that just joined, this is sent by already connected users that have a copy of recent messages.

### Updated data sync api
To wait for the data to be fully synced from the network you can now simply await these publicly exposed promises:

### Features
* Local cache using an iframe
  IPFS and OrbitDB data is now shared between dapps. The data is now stored in an iframe instead of being replicated between each dapp.
* Network cache
  When syncing public profiles of users a centralized caching service is now used by default. This speeds up the process of getting multiple public profiles at once. This feature can be disabled in favor for the decentralized approach.
* GraphQL queries
  It's now possible to encode GraphQL queries for public profiles. This allows for queries of only the relevant information of profiles.
* Ethereum address proof
  The proof that links users ethereum address to their 3Box profile is now stored in their 3Box.
